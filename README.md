# FinalV_Laravel_Test_TODO_App


## Instructions for the TODO App

Please check out the PDF file "updated_laravel_instructionsfile_pdfversion.pdf" . It contains information about the steps to follow to run the app:
- The requirements for the project (basically Docker Desktop and a terminal...);
- How to run the project;
- Some explanations and guidelines (with images);
- Testing commands.

Note: first run of the app might take some time to build as there are packages needed to be installed (depending on the pc config this can go for some minutes - it really depends on setup).


## Important for windows users

As said in the pdf, to run the app you need to simply have docker & docker compose (with docker desktop it's easy). But also to be able to run scripts bash. For winows sometimes this can be tricky and require additional steps.
In that scenario (can't run bash scripts), just simply copy paste the contents (commands) of the setup.sh file and run them in the terminal. 
The docker compose commands are not a problem to run on the terminal if Docker Desktop is installed. 



## Tech stack used

Versions: just in case, even though this is not needed as the dockerfiles are configured to deal with everything (to avoid dependencies issues).
 
Laravel 10.2.x
PHP 8.1.x
Vue 3.x
